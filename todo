support exponential numbers
memory leak in Object, when crushing a value
allow apostrophe not to be escaped when parsing, and do not escape it with stringify


no need for unicode because we support utf8:
   JSON text SHALL be encoded in UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.  The default
   encoding is UTF-8, and JSON texts that are encoded in UTF-8 are
   interoperable in the sense that they will be read successfully by the
   maximum number of implementations; there are many implementations
   that cannot successfully read texts in other encodings (such as
   UTF-16 and UTF-32).
